# MyBank-Django
The project is a banking app made using python and django with admin and customer roles. Admins manage customers (register, modify, delete, view) but can't view passwords or balances. Customers log in, view their account, deposit, withdraw (no negative balance), and close their account. Transaction history is viewable/downloadable as a PDF.
